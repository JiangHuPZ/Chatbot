The page provides details about the program, including examples of commodity areas, diversity designations used by MIT, and links to MIT’s small business enterprise list. It also directs the community to VPF’s\xa0Supplier Search, where they can filter their search results of Preferred Suppliers by various diversity designations.\n\nIn his July letter to the MIT community on addressing systemic racism at MIT, President Reif committed the Institute to increase purchasing and contracting with minority and Black-led businesses.\xa0“MIT has long placed importance on working with a diverse range of suppliers,” says Christina Lo, VPF Director of Strategic Sourcing and Contracts. “We are working to expand our data on these suppliers to provide the community with information to make deliberate and intentional purchasing decisions.”\xa0At the Institute’s Day of Dialogue in August, Christina and Emma Homstad, VPF’s Small and Diverse Business Program Coordinator, shared plans for the program and gathered feedback from members of the community. “A metrics-driven evaluation was a key point many participants brought up in that conversation, along with the need for tools to assist purchasers in making decisions that align with MIT’s mission and values,” says Emma. “We are in the process of gathering and analyzing the data on Institute spending to identify a baseline on which to build actionable and measurable targets for the future. Then we can engage the community in dialogue about how best to set Institute guidelines and objectives for growing our participation in procurement activities with diverse businesses.”\xa0“It’s a call to action,” says Christina. “Buying is an activity that the Institute does every day. Deciding to purchase from small and diverse businesses can help move the needle toward greater equity and create opportunities that will create change and address economic injustice.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\nJun\n21FY2023 Year-End Workshop #2 (10:00 am - 11:30 am)\n\n\nJul\n12Excel: Advanced\n\n\n\nMore Events\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n \n\n                New Local Video Production Firms Sign on as Preferred Suppliers: Devlo Media, Giro Studios, Glass Ink Media, and Steer (Forward)\n            \nStrategic Sourcing has added four video companies as Preferred Suppliers.

Each episode features center researchers and staff who welcome experts from the field for in depth conversations about business education, and beyond. On today's episode, MIT's sustainable supply chains director, Alexis Bateman speaks with Nalini Bates and Kris Oswold, after a roundtable on supplier diversity, equity and inclusion. The three share challenges and insights from the discussion and offer pointers for others, aiming to advance D, E, and I in their organizations. Take it away, Alexis.\nAlexis Bateman:\nThanks for joining today. My name's Alexis Bateman. I'm the director of MIT sustainable supply chains. At our lab, we have been looking at supply chain sustainability broadly. One of the topics that has emerged, which is under the umbrella of the United Nations sustainable development goals is diversity, equity and inclusion. Today we're very fortunate to have two long-term supplier diversity professionals, Kris Oswold from UPS and Nalini Bates from Procter and Gamble. Welcome.\nKris Oswold:\nHello, my name is Kris Oswold. I'm with UPS and I'm the vice president of global supplier diversity.\nNalini Bates:\nThanks for having me. This is Nalini Bates from Procter and Gamble. I lead what we call supplier citizenship at P&G. So that is both supplier diversity and responsible sourcing sitting in our purchases function.\nAlexis Bateman:\nI think today we wanted to join together just to reflect on some of the learnings about the roundtable and generally around supplier diversity, equity inclusion. What do you think were some of the points of disagreement or challenges that came up in the roundtable? Maybe I can turn this over to Kris to start and then get Nalini's reflections.\nKris Oswold:\nThanks Alexis, and let me thank you for putting the roundtable together because events like this are so important to really feed some provocative discussions and get some issues out on the table. We were able to do that in this format, which was wonderful. I don't like to frame them as disagreements because in many cases, it's just causing us to think about things in a different way and maybe recognize challenges that we haven't been addressing, or we haven't been talking about to the level that's needed. I think we were able to surface a number of challenges, which is good because that's where you have to start. If you don't know what your challenges are, how are we ever going to drive change and how are we ever going to make really a step change and impact our supplier diversity on economic inclusion? So these types of discussions are important.\nKris Oswold:\nI'll start with one. One of, I think, the areas of challenge, and Nalini did a great job in the roundtable, talking about this, has to do with metrics and how you set up your metrics around a supplier diversity program to drive the right behavior. One of the challenges that we often don't talk about as much as we should is that with such a focus on spend and how much money we spend with diverse suppliers, that can cause behaviors that over-focus on a dollar amount of spend and maybe under focus on the impact that spend is having on communities.\nKris Oswold:\nWe see that when we see supplier diversity programs that maybe really concentrate spend on just a handful of suppliers. Those suppliers are great suppliers and they're bringing great value to the corporations. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that. But if that's the focus of the program, is just driving spend, we miss the opportunity to impact more suppliers and broader communities. I think that's one of the key challenges that we see in supplier diversity, and Nalini led a great discussion on it, I appreciate it.\nNalini Bates:\nYeah, I couldn't agree more with how she articulated one of ... well, my take away, that was one of the biggest challenges we're all talking about. We all feel like economic inclusion and economic impact is what we are trying to drive with the work we do. Those of us who get to do this every day understand that this is complicated. There are many ways that we can help drive economic empowerment in our supply chains. That is with diverse-owned companies, but we have other tools in that toolbox.\nNalini Bates:\nWe have to think about encouraging suppliers to have diverse workforces. We have to encourage our suppliers to have diversity in their leadership and in their board of directors. All of this together can have the same economic impact that we have been working so hard on with this traditional supplier diversity program. I think when it comes to things like certification and the definition of how we certify, Kris's discussion on that was really enlightening because, and I agree it's not necessarily a disagreement on how to move forward, but I do think it's a challenge on if we want to think more holistically there are some of these traditional measures and metrics that we do have to think differently about. Putting some structure around that, I think, across corporations and academia might be a great place to move going forward.\nKris Oswold:\nFor sure. You know, Alexis, if I could jump in, I think the role of academia is so critical here because corporations like UPS, like P&G, we've been working at this for decades. We've worked with nonprofit agencies and within government programs in some cases. Good work gets done, but we have not really moved the needle, of late, in terms of the scale of impact. I think it is because this is a hard set of ships to move. We're nonprofits who are dependent upon corporate dollars, governments have their own prioritization and impact us in different ways. A step and a role for academia is important to bring some objectivity and some rigor to what we're doing, and I think that can help us drive change.\nKris Oswold:\nThere was another key challenge that came up, and I don't recall who brought this up, but I think is really important. That is the amplification of the value of what we do in supplier diversity if we are better coordinated across various functions and pillars of diversity in our organization. Oftentimes we think of diversity around employment. We think of it as suppliers, many of us look at communities and customers as well. When we better coordinate as corporations across the functions that support each of those constituencies, we can better understand the value of what we do and then optimize our investments and optimize our work.\nKris Oswold:\nWhen I collaborate with marketing and we think about what can we do to help diverse businesses grow, then I've got a marketing piece that says small business growth is part of our strategy, we're in, how can we help? How can we invest? What can we offer? We're in from the procurement side as well. When I partnered with our foundation and they say, we're investing in philanthropic efforts. I'm like, you know what? If we shift a little bit of that investment over into some of this economic area for businesses, we can grow a customer base and grow a supplier base, and you start amplifying those impacts. I think historically supplier diversity has often been isolated in companies as a group. The extent that more companies can see the synergy of looking at all the pillars of D, E, and I together and collaborating on messaging and investment and prioritization, I think this is a huge, huge opportunity for us that not everybody is tapping into yet.\nNalini Bates:\nYeah, and I would add maybe a different spin on the same topic. There might be things we can learn from the environmental sustainability work that I think we're all aware of too, but there has been a lot of work in the last 10 years to come together across industry, as Kris was saying, across the value chain to really think about what are the priorities. There's been alignment on how to measure some of that environmental sustainability work.\nNalini Bates:\nI think one of the really interesting brainstorming topics coming out of the roundtable is how can we follow that same path when it comes to D, E and I, and how can we think about common metrics and defining impact? Then being able to measure that within our businesses. I think that is the desired end state, but lots of questions and challenges on how to get there.\nKris Oswold:\nTo follow up on that, I don't know, Nalini, did you want to potentially encapsulate one key takeaway from that day?\nNalini Bates:\nFor me, and just probably given the journey that we are on at P&G, this idea of how to measure the impact corporations can make is probably the most critical question that I have to think about. We spend tens of billions of dollars every day. So when I talk to my buyers around the world, that's a great responsibility to spend that money buying things and from companies that further our purpose values, and principles that we hold so dear at P&G.\nNalini Bates:\nSo how do you find those like-minded suppliers to build a value chain that is really furthering everything that we're aiming to do across equality and inclusion, sustainability, community impact, all of that CSR type of work? There's definitely a greater role that our buyers, the purchasing area, our supply chain colleagues can play. But this question about how to measure the impact when you do that outside of your company, to me, is the key question for us going forward.\nAlexis Bateman:\nAnything Kris, for you that was like a key, aha moment?\nKris Oswold:\nSure. There were a lot of great moments. I think one thing that has probably resonated with me the longest and I've thought about the most since we finished up the roundtable are thinking through some of the unintended consequences of our current certification model. We had a great conversation challenging whether or not the certifications as they're done today are really serving our purpose. I think it's important to think about that in terms of have we created some unintended consequences that are running counter to our purpose? We had a discussion around as certifying minority businesses, should we stop and think have we created some form of a black tax by adding effort and expense to a process for folks to get that extra support to bid on a corporate contract?\nKris Oswold:\nWe don't have all the answers yet, but I think we'll never get the answers unless we start really digging into some of the assumptions that we've made, that how we've worked historically and how certifications have worked historically will serve us into the future. I'm not sure that's true. I think there was some great discussion around maybe it's not a one size fits, maybe it's not only one certification that we need. Maybe there are other considerations that we need to think about to be able to broaden the network and bring more diverse businesses in and engage more corporations in this work.\nAlexis Bateman:\nYes. I think that was such a critical point and such an important point of view, to kind of revisit these long-held assumptions, this is the right way that this works for everyone. Where in some cases, in many cases, it's a barrier to entry when that's not really the original purpose of some of those approaches. Given that you both have long-standing programs at your organizations, we're seeing a lot of new entrants to a D, E, and I in general, but also supplier diversity. Do you see that continuing into 2021? Maybe what is the key issue here of the depth of investment? Do you worry that perhaps there'll be new entrants that are not doing it as well and as completely as they should be? Maybe I'll turn that to Nalini to start.\nNalini Bates:\nIt's a great question because I think for those of us like Kris and I, who have been part of organizations that have been doing this a long time, I think we probably both get a lot of phone calls from our peers that are starting out or through the roundtable type discussions where we try to informally coach others as they try to stand up their programs.\nNalini Bates:\nThere are some great things about that and there's also some risks to that. Clearly, as we just talked about today, going forward, we have to do things differently. So if we continue to coach others who are setting a foundation for their program, the way we've done ours, perhaps we miss an opportunity. So I think it's really important that we also encourage these new entrants to potentially think about this in a different way. In a way, they have less to lose by trying something different and then we can learn from them. It's a great example of how it's important that we bring to the table people with all sorts of different experience. It truly is a place where we all learn. It's not just a one one-way, we learn just as much.\nAlexis Bateman:\nGood words, and thinking about how there's an opportunity there for these new entrants bringing new ideas and bringing fresh perspectives. Maybe the last kind of concluding thoughts, any advice to those newly starting up the supplier diversity programs and the path ahead?\nKris Oswold:\nAlthough there have been programs that are around forever, it really is a greenfield on how you approach it. I think what's important is that you align your focus to your corporate strategy. For businesses that try to do this as a, everybody else is doing it, I guess we need one of these approaches, will very likely, almost always struggle with resources and buy-in from stakeholders and trying to get the seat at the table to get people to try new suppliers.\nKris Oswold:\nIf you align what you're trying to accomplish with supplier diversity with your corporate strategy, your growth strategy, then you've got a business reason and you have economics behind what you're trying to do. That makes it so much more powerful. Value alignment is important, of course, but today, shame on any company that doesn't have D, E, and I as part of their values. Value alignment alone is not going to be enough to make the program real. Make sure you are aligned very, very closely to your corporate strategy, and that will get you the support you need to make the investments and drive the change.\nNalini Bates:\nKris stole mine. Of course, having it aligned with your corporation's [inaudible 00:14:59] strategy is critical. The second thing I would say is try to prioritize. I think this is something that is also hard. I think a lot of us feel like there is so much opportunity, that we want to do a million things. Really forcing yourself to prioritize and get some quick wins and gain momentum, while it might feel hard in the moment, longterm will probably be more beneficial.\nAlexis Bateman:\nI just want to thank you both for joining and summarizing the learnings of the day, but just really especially bringing your expert insights on supplier diversity, equity inclusion. We can foresee this continuing to be a key focus area going forward and hope that we can continue to bring awareness, bring recognition of the importance of this issue and scaling efforts. So thank you both for your time and thanks everyone for joining us today.\nKris Oswold:\nThanks, Alexis, and thank you to MIT and the center for putting this together, incredibly valuable.\nNalini Bates:\nYes. Thank you so much. I appreciate the invitation and look forward to helping out however I can, going forward.\nAnnouncer - Arthur Grau:\nAll right, everyone. Thank you for listening.

The updates are designed to expedite the process while ensuring MIT’s compliance with federal and state regulations.\n\nFewer documents to submit:\xa0Independent contractors are no longer required to submit a resume and a list of clients as part of the registration process.\nOne less signature:\xa0The Domestic Registration Form no longer requires a digital signature, as the contractor’s signature on the W-9 form is sufficient for registration purposes.\nCertification built into the process:\xa0The contractor can certify their status as an independent contractor through a new section on the form. Once a contractor is registered and remains active at MIT, VPF will contact them every two years and ask them to recertify their status.\xa0Please note, contractors who have an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS\xa0are required\xa0to complete the Independent Contractor registration process.\nThese changes are reflected on the VPF website’s updated\xa0Request a New Supplier\xa0page,\xa0VPF Buying and Paying\xa0policies\xa06.00\xa0and\xa06.06, and\xa0all related forms. If you saved the previous versions of these forms on your computer, please delete them and download the\xa0updated forms\xa0for use going forward.\nKeep in Mind...\nAll new\xa0supplier requests should include complete supplier contact information. VPF will contact suppliers directly for missing forms or other information. If, after five business days, the supplier does not respond to VPF’s request, the requisition will be returned to the requester for direct follow-up with the supplier.\xa0\nAll suppliers are strongly encouraged to join the\xa0Coupa Supplier Portal (CSP), where they can manage orders, submit invoices, and track payments. Suppliers can register to join the Coupa Supplier Portal (CSP) on the registration form.\nIf you have questions about registering new suppliers contact VPF at\xa0B2P@mit.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\nJun\n21FY2023 Year-End Workshop #2 (10:00 am - 11:30 am)\n\n\nJul\n12Excel: Advanced\n\n\n\nMore Events\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n \n\n                New Local Video Production Firms Sign on as Preferred Suppliers: Devlo Media, Giro Studios, Glass Ink Media, and Steer (Forward)\n            \nStrategic Sourcing has added four video companies as Preferred Suppliers.

Bateman\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\nOn January 12, 2021, the MIT Center for Transportation & Logistics (CTL) convened a virtual roundtable to explore key topics across supplier diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I). Participants represented nine industries within manufacturing, retail, and services, and their companies were at various points in their supplier diversity (SD) journey, which enabled an exchange of experiences and fresh perspectives on the challenges, opportunities, and future of supplier diversity.\nThe roundtable opened with an overview of CTL’s research on Supplier Diversity, followed by three topical sessions: metrics, supplier certification, and program design best practices. Each session began with a kickoff presentation by a company sharing its experiences and lessons learned, followed by a discussion of the issues. To encourage open sharing, no statements in this report have been attributed to any specific company.\xa0\nThe metrics session revealed that most companies quantify supplier diversity programs in terms of their spending with diverse-owned suppliers, measured as dollar amounts or percentages (with pros and cons of both approaches). Companies have been expanding their measurements from just Tier 1 diverse suppliers to include diverse spending in Tier 2 and deeper. Supplier diversity programs are evolving to encompass more metrics that assess the broader impacts of diversity programs on diverse suppliers, employees, and communities, such as making a difference in economic empowerment. Participants also sought to standardize SD program metrics, benchmarks, and dashboards so as to reduce suppliers’ time and costs of reporting and to aid communication that could extend adoption of SD principles.\xa0\nThe certification session showed that most companies require third-party certification of diverse suppliers’ ownership to ensure the validity of the company’s diversity claims. However, the onerous certification process acts as a tax on the very companies it seeks to help; only about 1 percent of diverse companies achieve certification despite meeting the required criteria. Moreover, current ownership-focused certification misses many alternative types of supplier diversity efforts (e.g., in diversity hiring, development, management composition, and community support) that can aid in economic advancement of historically disadvantaged communities.\xa0\nParticipants wanted to influence certifiers to both ease the access barrier for suppliers and to expand the ways suppliers can be counted as diverse.\xa0\nDiscussions of best practices in designing SD programs focused on assessing and scoring the health of the diverse suppliers—measuring the trend in each supplier’s current and expected future business with the company. The onus was then on companies’ purchasing teams to craft supplier development plans in which green-scoring suppliers have a growth strategy, yellow-scoring ones have a plan for moving to green status, and red-scoring ones have a fix or an intended disposition. Driving greater supply chain DE&I means working with all suppliers to increase DE&I efforts in Tier 1 and deeper tiers of the supply chain. Global rollouts of diversity programs face added challenges in defining locally-appropriate categories of diversity and finding such suppliers in other countries.\xa0\nOverall, participants advocated for more collaboration between companies, suppliers, and certifiers to help expand diversity, equity, and inclusion in supply chains.\nLeave us your email to\xa0download the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNavigate\n\n\nNews\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nFor the Press\n\n\nContact\n\n\nGive\n\n\nJoin Our Mailing List\n\n\nEmail Webmaster\n\n\nPartner Login\n\n\nPartner Registration\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nContact\nMIT E40, Floor 2\n1 Amherst Street\nCambridge, MA 02142\n\n\nConnect\nfacebook\ntwitter\nlinked in\nyoutube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", metadata={'source': 'https://ctl.mit.edu/pub/report/supplier-diversity-metrics-certification-and-program-best-practices', 'title': 'Supplier Diversity: Metrics, Certification, and Program Best Practices | Center for Transportation and Logistics', 'description': 'On January 12, 2021, the MIT Center for Transportation & Logistics (CTL) convened a virtual roundtable to explore key topics across supplier diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I).

My experience includes stints as a global management consultant, a corporate procurement executive and a procurement software entrepreneur.\nAlong this journey, I learned that diverse and inclusive supply chains are more competitive, able to unlock innovation, provide access to new markets and deliver socioeconomic impact in local operating markets.\n\xa0\n\nCompetitive Advantage\nDuring my tenure as chief procurement officer (CPO) of a billion-dollar telecommunications company, we were always searching for new, unique diverse suppliers that would enable us to enhance our offerings and provide healthy competition for incumbent suppliers.\n\nI learned that casting a wider net enabled us to build a supplier portfolio that included a broader range of supplier segments. This ultimately allowed us to increase spend with diverse suppliers, drive higher procurement cost savings and optimize overall supply chain value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation\n\n\n\n\nInnovation is defined as the creation, development and implementation of a new product, process or service with the aim of improving efficiency, effectiveness or competitive advantage. I have been involved in several instances where a new product, process or service was implemented by a top-notch supplier that happened to be diverse. However, my favorite story is about an emerging company that I discovered at a tradeshow.\nThis company produced modems that enabled internet service for our customers. After conducting some due diligence, I learned that — with some engineering tweaks — this modem could be compatible with our proprietary network at a significant reduction in cost. This innovative, diverse company was eventually invited to participate in a competitive supplier selection process and was awarded a multimillion-dollar contract that resulted in a significant increase in gross margins for our company.\n\xa0\nAccess To New Markets\nAnother lesson learned is that, in addition to increased supply chain competition, innovation and lower cost, diverse suppliers can also deliver access to new customer markets. One of my favorite examples is from a client engagement with a large business services firm where our team was developing a supplier diversity strategy, vision and roadmap.\nIn addition to delivering multimillion-dollar annual cost savings, coupled with a double-digit increase in diversity spend across numerous spend categories, the team uncovered a significant new revenue opportunity for the client via a partnership with a diverse supplier that provided access to a federal contract that required more capacity than the diverse supplier could provide alone. This is a great example of connecting the dots between the value of supplier diversity and market share growth.\n\xa0\nSocioeconomic Impact\nAccording to the\xa0U.S. Small Business Administration report, 99.9% of U.S. businesses fall within the definition of small business and account for 65% of net new jobs generated over the last 20 years. Over 50% of those businesses are either minority- or woman-owned but only represent 7% of the estimated $30 trillion generated annually by all firms.\nOver the years, I have been fortunate to experience the impact of intentional efforts to introduce small, innovative diverse suppliers to corporate supply chain opportunities around the world. These companies tend to hire diverse teams and reinvest in their local communities.\n\xa0\nSupply Chain Diversity: A Strategic Imperative\nOver the past 20 years, supply chain diversity has evolved from a compliance-driven initiative to a corporate strategic imperative for leading corporations, with a goal of driving economic impact within diverse communities.\nFor example, the\xa0Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR)\xa0“was created in 2001 to recognize and celebrate corporations that have achieved spending of at least $1 billion annually with minority- and woman-owned suppliers.” This has become a badge of honor for corporations truly committed to economic inclusion.\nHere are three ways you can accelerate supply chain diversity in your company:\n1. Determine where your procurement dollars are going.\nDeveloping a baseline understanding of where external procurement dollars are spent and with whom is essential to building a more diverse and inclusive supply chain.\nFor example, let’s say your organization spends $100 million annually across a handful of major categories, including real estate and facilities, marketing, IT (hardware and software) and professional services. You are now armed with the knowledge of where to focus diverse supplier inclusion efforts. During this process, you may discover opportunities to enhance existing diverse supplier relationships that drive increased profitability. There are data classification/enrichment technology and tools that aid the process of identifying suppliers by diversity status (minority, woman, etc.).\n2. Identify diverse suppliers aligned with key spend categories.\nOnce you have an understanding of the major categories of spend, you can begin the process of broadening your pool of potential suppliers within each category.\nIn addition to querying people you know and trust about diverse suppliers they have worked with in the past, supplier diversity certification and advocacy organizations, such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and Women’s Business National Enterprise Council (WBENC), are great platforms for connecting with diverse suppliers. There are also services that focus on offering access to databases of vetted diverse suppliers.\n3. Establish inclusive procurement policies.\nImplement “The Rule of 1,” which requires the inclusion of at least one diverse supplier in competitive supplier selection/RFP (request for proposal) processes.\n\xa0\nConclusion\nIt is within the context of this commitment that I relate my own personal journey as a minority entrepreneur. I launched my procurement software startup 10 years ago with a handful of employees. After two years of relentless pursuit of success, we landed a contract with a major corporation. This contract enabled us to grow from four to 11 employees. By the time we were acquired last year, we had grown to 35 employees. Of those 35 employees, 50% were women and 40% were an ethnic minority.\nThis truly embodies the power of diverse supply chains.

These B2B programs are intended to make it easier for small businesses or those owned and operated by people from socially or economically disadvantaged groups, such as minorities, women, the LGBTQ community, and veterans, to win contracts and sell their goods and services. For instance, Google’s supplier diversity program has helped small and minority-owned businesses win contracts for a wide variety of commodity products and for services like transportation and catering. \nSuch businesses are vital to the economy and society of the United States. Small businesses alone account for nearly half of the country’s GDP and have created over 60% of the country’s new jobs in recent years. Women own 40% of all businesses in the U.S., and ethnic minorities own nearly 30%. Taken together, these numbers make small and diverse businesses a key facet of the U.S. economy — and the numbers will continue to rise.\n\n\nGet Updates on Transformative Leadership\n\nEvidence-based resources that can help you lead your team more effectively, delivered to your inbox monthly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                sign\xa0up            \n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\nThank you for signing up\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nMany companies describe the implementation of these supplier diversity initiatives as a moral decision and treat them as an investment in corporate social responsibility, demonstrating that their company stands for a set of core values. But despite these initiatives’ economic and social significance, their success has been mixed, due in part to doubts about their effectiveness. \nAssumptions of Financial Inefficiency Results in Lackluster Support\nDespite the fact that many large businesses proudly describe their supplier diversity initiatives on their websites, very few of them actually report the key results or disclose how many of their contracts are won by diverse suppliers. This lack of disclosure easily leads to cynicism; big companies may pay lip service or implement half measures, but it’s unclear how much they embrace and practice supplier diversity. \nSome buyers fear that such initiatives do not make financial sense — that choosing to buy from any but the cheapest business increases their purchasing costs. Some politicians and analysts have criticized supplier diversity initiatives as financially inefficient and relevant monitoring systems as weak or lacking. \n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nOperations\n\n\nSocial Responsibility\n\n\nSupply Chains & Logistics\n\n\nClimate Change\n\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility\n\n\nEquality\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Authors\nSimha Mummalaneni is assistant professor of marketing at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business.

Investors are pouring their money into funds designed to promote social good, and one company after another is announcing initiatives to encourage diversity and inclusion. Until now, driving economic growth and confronting social equity haven’t necessarily gone hand in hand. Today, companies can not only meet both requirements but also combine them into a competitive advantage by procuring more from diverse suppliers — defined as small businesses or companies owned by minorities, women, veterans, members of the LGBT community, or people with disabilities. \nSupplier diversity and inclusion initiatives can make a significant difference to companies’ revenues and to communities. First, customers are three times more likely to purchase a product or service from a brand they perceive to be committed to diversity and inclusion. Second, directing $1 million in procurement spending toward diverse suppliers can create as many as 10 new jobs, according to research conducted by diversity analytics provider Proximo. These jobs drive at least $124,000 in economic impact through tax revenues, helping to build local communities where the suppliers operate.\n\n\nGet Updates on Transformative Leadership\n\nEvidence-based resources that can help you lead your team more effectively, delivered to your inbox monthly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                sign\xa0up            \n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\nThank you for signing up\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nYet even though 85% of Fortune 100 companies in the United States have such initiatives, only 59% of these companies report how much they source from diverse suppliers, according to our research. These companies procure on average only 10% of their supplies and services from diverse suppliers. Moreover, much of this spending is directed toward small businesses, regardless of whether members of underrepresented groups own them. \nFew industries are well positioned to use their supply chains proactively to encourage diversity and inclusion. Telecommunications, health care, and pharmaceutical companies source the most from diverse businesses, in part because the government is a large customer and they have developed the infrastructure to do so over decades. These are followed by manufacturers and automotive companies, which pioneered supplier diversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Energy, financial services, and technology companies source little from companies owned by members of protected classes. (See “Percentage of Procurement From Diverse Suppliers, by Industry.”) \n\n\n\nPercentage of Procurement From Diverse Suppliers, by Industry\nIndustries vary widely in their patterns of procurement from diverse suppliers.\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSocial Responsibility\n\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility\n\n\nEquality\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Authors\nKarina Swette is a partner and Timi Boyo is a principal in Oliver Wyman’s operations practice.

Supplier diversity certifications are available from various entities, including the National Minority Supplier Development Council, Women’s Business Enterprise National Council, National LGBT Chamber of Commerce, United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Asian Pacific American Chamber of Commerce, Native American Chamber of Commerce, Vets First Verification Program (for small businesses owned by veterans), and Disability:IN (for small businesses owned by people with disabilities). \n\n\nTags: \n\nBusiness Relationships\nPurchasing Decisions\n\n\n \n\nMore Like This\n\n \n\n\nAdd a comment Cancel replyYou must sign in to post a comment.First time here?
